          <p>
            In a lot of mech games, heat is a slap on the wrist.
          </p>
          <p>
            You hold the trigger, a bar quietly fills, and then—without much warning—you lose control for a few seconds while your mech "cools down." The details don't matter; the message is just "you shot too much."
          </p>
          <p>
            PHALANX treats heat as something else:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Heat is a budget. You spend it for pressure. Overheating is what happens when you don't manage that budget.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            That budget is wired directly into:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chassis and loadouts</strong> – how much heat you can carry and how fast you vent it.</li>
            <li><strong>Weapons and abilities</strong> – explicit, table-driven heat costs alongside damage and energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Stability</strong> – running hot makes you easier to stagger, but only in clearly signposted ways.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal isn't to scare you away from the redline. It's to make "I'll push my mech to the edge for this fight" a conscious decision rather than a coin flip.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>1. The heat budget: chassis first, then loadout</h3>
          <p>
            Every mech in PHALANX has a real, finite heat capacity behind the 0–100% HUD bar. The percentage is just presentation; the actual capacity depends on the chassis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conceptually:
          </p>

          <div class="article-code draw-left-line">
            <p class="article-code-file mark-section">heat_profile.h (conceptual)</p>
            <pre class="article-code-text cpp">struct HeatProfile {
  int   heat_capacity;     // total heat points this frame can hold
  float passive_cool_rate; // % of capacity cooled per second at rest
  float move_cool_scalar;  // cooling multiplier while moving
  float vent_efficiency;   // how strong active vents are
};</pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            Broadly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Light frames have lower capacity, but relatively aggressive cooling.</li>
            <li>Medium frames sit in the middle on both.</li>
            <li>Heavy / assault frames carry larger capacity, but shed heat more slowly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So when two mechs both show "70% heat":
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>On a light, that's a small buffer with fast recovery.</li>
            <li>On an assault, that's a large amount of stored heat you'll drag around for a while.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Loadouts then reshape that budget:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weapons define <code>heat_per_shot</code> and, for beams or channels, <code>heat_per_second</code>.</li>
            <li>Passive modules tweak:
              <ul>
                <li>total capacity (+10% capacity, -10% cooling),</li>
                <li>cooling curves (+20% cooling, -15% capacity),</li>
                <li>or one-off vent behaviors (dump N% of current heat on activation).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            High-output builds are exactly that on paper:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>They stack weapons and abilities with high heat throughput,</li>
            <li>Then compensate with less buffer, weaker cooling, or both.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            "Runs hot" stops being a vibe and becomes a literal line in the loadout: you chose a narrower, more punishing thermal envelope in exchange for damage.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>2. Weapons and abilities: heat as just another column</h3>
          <p>
            Nothing in PHALANX produces heat implicitly. If something warms your mech, there's a row for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A weapon entry (simplified) might look like:
          </p>

          <div class="article-code draw-left-line">
            <p class="article-code-file mark-section">weapon_heat_params.h (conceptual)</p>
            <pre class="article-code-text cpp">struct WeaponHeatParams {
  float heat_per_shot;      // burst cost per trigger pull
  float heat_per_second;    // additional cost while held/channeled
  float cool_down_rate;     // local cooling when idle
  float high_heat_scalar;   // extra cost when firing in high-heat bands
};</pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            An ability entry:
          </p>

          <div class="article-code draw-left-line">
            <p class="article-code-file mark-section">ability_resources.h (conceptual)</p>
            <pre class="article-code-text cpp">struct AbilityResources {
  float energy_cost;
  float heat_cost;
  float cooldown_s;

  bool  usable_at_high_heat;
  bool  usable_while_soft_staggered;

  float high_band_heat_scalar; // e.g. 1.2x self-heat when > threshold
};</pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            Practically, this buys you a few things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A sustained-fire gun can be cheap per shot but expensive per second, pushing you into Strained if you never cadence.</li>
            <li>A burst weapon can hit hard, spike heat, then let you cool while you reposition.</li>
            <li>A dash or lunge can:
              <ul>
                <li>damage the target,</li>
                <li>apply stability,</li>
                <li>and also add a small heat spike to the caster—making repeated YOLO dives a thermal choice, not just a positioning one.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A vent / recenter style ability can be defined explicitly as:
              <ul>
                <li>"spend energy and cooldown to throw away X% of current heat."</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Because heat lives alongside damage, energy, and cooldown in the same tables, "this feels too free" or "this feels unusably hot" typically reduces to a data question, not a mystery behavior.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>3. Heat bands: safe, strained, critical, and shutdown</h3>
          <p>
            The heat bar is continuous; the behavior isn't. Internally, it's interpreted in bands with specific rules.
          </p>

          <h4>3.1 Safe – normal operating envelope</h4>
          <p>
            Roughly the lower half of the bar.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Passive cooling works at the chassis' advertised rate.</li>
            <li>Stability behaves as if you were "cold."</li>
            <li>Most weapons and abilities use their baseline heat values.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can dump a magazine here to win a trade and expect to recover without structural penalties, as long as you then let the system do its job.
          </p>

          <h4>3.2 Strained – you're spending buffer</h4>
          <p>
            Once you cross into a middle band (think ~50–75%):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Passive cooling is still fine, but not enough if you continue firing flat-out.</li>
            <li>Many weapons and abilities start to apply a mild high-heat scalar to their own heat cost.</li>
            <li>Stability picks up small penalties:
              <ul>
                <li>slightly lower effective stability threshold,</li>
                <li>slightly longer stagger durations on hits that do push you over.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You're still in control, but you've stopped coasting and started borrowing against a finite reserve. The system is gently telling you: if you keep going like this, other bars will start to care.
          </p>

          <h4>3.3 Critical – this is the redline</h4>
          <p>
            The upper band (~75–99%) is Critical. Entering it is effectively a statement: "I am committing everything to this next interaction."
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, several knobs turn together:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stability:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>thresholds are reduced more noticeably,</li>
                <li>stagger durations stretch out by a meaningful chunk.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ability rules:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>some high-output skills are now locked,</li>
                <li>others explicitly become "unsafe to cast" and will warn you,</li>
                <li>panic tools and vents remain usable, by design.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cooling:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>passive cooling alone won't take you straight back to Safe in a couple of seconds,</li>
                <li>you either pause or hit an active vent-style tool.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The key point: you don't wake up in Critical by accident. You got there by repeatedly pulling triggers and pressing buttons that all had clear heat entries.
          </p>

          <h4>3.4 Shutdown – the visible line you cross</h4>
          <p>
            Once you exceed capacity, you hit Shutdown:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your mech drops into a powered-down state for a short, fixed window (on the order of a few seconds).</li>
            <li>The visuals match a severe stagger/knockdown:
              <ul>
                <li>reactors flaring,</li>
                <li>heat shimmer, smoke, venting panels,</li>
                <li>clear "systems offline" UI and audio.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When you come back:
              <ul>
                <li>weapon and movement systems restore in a known order,</li>
                <li>heat is clamped back down below the critical band so you don't instantly re-trigger.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Mechanically and visually, shutdown is designed as "the obvious endpoint of ignoring your heat budget," not a surprise dice roll.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>4. Heat and stability: one system nudging another</h3>
          <p>
            Heat doesn't just sit next to stability. It nudges it, and vice versa—but within hard bounds.
          </p>

          <h4>From heat → stability:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In Safe, stability behaves exactly as defined by chassis and loadout.</li>
            <li>In Strained, heat applies a small penalty:
              <ul>
                <li>slightly easier to stagger,</li>
                <li>staggers linger a bit longer.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In Critical, those penalties become noticeable:
              <ul>
                <li>you can still play, but you are clearly more topple-prone than a cold mech.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>From stability → heat:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A hard stagger may add a short heat spike as thrusters and jets fight to catch your posture.</li>
            <li>A knockdown or shutdown often goes hand-in-hand with emergency venting, dropping heat more aggressively as systems cut power.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The cross-terms are intentionally modest. Running hot absolutely makes you easier to abuse if you get caught, but it doesn't automatically collapse into "one bad mistake and I never stand up again."
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>5. Guardrails: no endless spirals</h3>
          <p>
            Any cross-coupled system can turn into a death spiral if you let it. Most of the "safety rails" around heat and stability are there to prevent exactly that.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the stability side:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>There's a hard cap on how many full staggers you can suffer in quick succession before you get a short stagger immunity window.</li>
            <li>There's also a cap on how much total time you can spend in hard stagger inside a rolling window.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On the heat side:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shutdown has a fixed duration, not "until you cool to X%."</li>
            <li>Coming back from shutdown resets you to a controlled heat range and doesn't secretly kneecap your future cooling.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            On the feedback side:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Heat bands are clearly indicated on the HUD and in VFX/audio.</li>
            <li>The moment where Strained becomes Critical is obvious.</li>
            <li>There are no hidden "by the way, your regen is halved now" breakpoints.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So you can absolutely be punished for greedily riding 90% heat and 80% stability into a bad angle—but you're not going to be stun-locked and shut down forever because of one mistake three fights ago.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>6. Heat, abilities, and playstyle</h3>
          <p>
            Heat is most interesting when it bends how you actually play, not just how often you shoot.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few patterns the system leans on:
          </p>

          <h4>6.1 Vents and posture resets</h4>
          <p>
            Some abilities exist almost entirely to let you buy back heat on purpose:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spend energy and cooldown,</li>
            <li>Drop a chunk of heat instantly,</li>
            <li>Momentarily slow or lock some weapons or movement modes,</li>
            <li>Often usable in soft stagger but not in hard stagger or shutdown.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Used early, they keep you out of Critical and away from shutdown. Used late, they're panic buttons that might save you if you time them perfectly—or do nothing if you waited too long.
          </p>

          <h4>6.2 High-commit skills that tax the caster</h4>
          <p>
            Aggressive tools often hit both ends of the interaction:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>They spike heat on the target via weapon use and stability damage,</li>
            <li>And add a smaller, non-trivial heat cost to you.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Light frames chaining high-commit lunges into every fight will feel this immediately: you get terrifying windows of burst pressure, followed by "I'm at 90% heat and one nudge away from falling over."
          </p>
          <p>
            Assault frames can push those windows longer, but when they do overstep, their slower cooling and higher mass mean stagger and shutdown punishes sting harder.
          </p>

          <h4>6.3 Heat as a visible trade</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, the combat feedback layer keeps heat readable:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The bar uses distinct colors and pulses for Safe / Strained / Critical.</li>
            <li>Material FX, weapon glows, and audio all ramp with heat.</li>
            <li>Stagger and shutdown visuals explicitly incorporate heat cues so you can see "this was a thermal failure" at a glance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal is that every "one more volley" feels like a visible trade:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>More damage now vs</li>
            <li>Less stability buffer and higher shutdown risk later.</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h3>7. One budget among many</h3>
          <p>
            Heat in PHALANX is deliberately not a mini-game off to the side. It's another line on the same ledger as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Health</strong> – how close you are to destruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Stability</strong> – how close you are to losing control.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat</strong> – how hard you're pushing the frame to get there.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When you finally overheat and your mech slumps into shutdown, the intended feeling is:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            You knew your chassis' envelope,<br>
            You chose a loadout that runs hot,<br>
            You pushed into the upper bands and stayed there,<br>

            And then the bill came due.
