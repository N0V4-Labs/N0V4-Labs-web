                        Hello! I'm Colin MacRitchie, also known as <strong>ShaiKKO</strong> in the tech community. 
                        I build engines, tools, and infrastructure for games that have to run fast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, most of that work is on PHALANX—a mech game targeting 144 FPS with tens of 
                        thousands of entities per frame. That means ECS wrappers, custom memory allocators, 
                        physics integration, and a lot of time staring at profilers trying to figure out where 
                        the milliseconds went.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm interested in the kind of problems where the obvious solution doesn't actually solve it. 
                        Cache-aware data layouts, predictable allocation patterns, pointer lifetimes, and the 
                        tradeoffs that come from trying to make something work reliably under load.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        I write systems code. The kind where you care about nanoseconds per operation and where 
                        "fast enough" has a number attached to it. The articles on this site cover the decisions 
                        that come out of that work:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entity-component systems that can handle 90k entities at 144 Hz</li>
                        <li>Memory systems with explicit budgets and frame/pool/heap splits</li>
                        <li>Physics-driven mechanics that replace hard stuns with continuous stability</li>
                        <li>The architectural choices that make or break frame time</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="about-section">
                    <h2>This Blog</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is where I write about the technical work—the tradeoffs, the surprises, and the 
                        things that looked good on paper but fell apart under load. If you're interested in 
                        low-level design, mechanical sympathy, or game engine internals, you'll probably find 
                        something useful here.
