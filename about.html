                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Colin MacRitchie, also known as ShaiKKO in the tech community. 
                        As a Principal Engineer, I've dedicated my career to building robust, scalable 
                        systems and leading technical teams to deliver exceptional software solutions.

                        that stand the test of time, and mentoring the next generation of engineers.
