            Classic hard knockdowns look simple on paper and feel terrible in practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            You eat a couple of shots, lose control of your mech, watch your camera tip into the floor, and then sit there while the rest of the fight happens to you. Designers get a lever labeled "stun duration." Players get a binary experience: fine or helpless. Any attempt to make the crowd control (CC) more expressive usually turns into a pile of special cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            PHALANX goes a different way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of a giant hidden "you're stunned now" flag, every mech carries a continuous <strong>stability budget</strong>. Weapons, abilities, and environmental events all push on that budget. The physics stagger system lives on top of it and decides, in a deterministic way, when you're wobbling, when you're in a full stagger, and when you've crossed the line into a rare full knockdown.
          </p>
          <p>
            This post is about that system: how the stability bar is structured, why it is explicitly class-scaled, and how we avoid the usual failure modes—perma-stagger, unreadable fights, and "I died without understanding why"—without losing the ability to punish greedy positioning.
          </p>

          <h3>Numbers first</h3>
          <p>
            As with the ECS layer, this starts with a small table of things that are allowed to happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stability system works on a simple scale:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stability scale:</strong> 0–100+ points (can overshoot the threshold)</li>
            <li><strong>Passive decay:</strong> 10 points/second while not taking stability damage</li>
            <li><strong>Update rate:</strong> 60 Hz</li>
            <li><strong>Typical stagger duration:</strong> 2.0–3.0 seconds (by class)</li>
            <li><strong>Typical knockdown duration:</strong> ~5.0 seconds (rare, expensive events only)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each mech class has its own stability threshold. A light mech hits the "you are out of balance" line much sooner than an assault, but recovers faster. An assault mech has the opposite profile: hard to topple, slow to come back once you get there.
          </p>

            <table>
              <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Class</th>
                <th>Stability Threshold</th>

                <td>70</td>
                <td>3.0 s</td>
                <td>Slow</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Assault</td>
                <td>90</td>
                <td>3.0 s</td>
                <td>Very slow</td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </figure>

          <p>
            The bar you see in the HUD fills from 0% upward as you take impacts. Under the hood, a light and an assault mech might both show "70% full," but those numbers mean different things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>On a <strong>light</strong> frame, 70% means "you are well past the stagger threshold; one more solid hit and you're flirting with hard stagger or knockdown."</li>
            <li>On an <strong>assault</strong> frame, 70% is still pre-stagger territory—dangerous, but not catastrophic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The HUD never asks you to track raw thresholds. It shows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <strong>class-colored bar</strong> with a clear threshold marker (a white tick at the class limit).</li>
            <li>A <strong>color ramp</strong> as you cross specific ranges:
              <ul>
                <li>0–30%: safe, green</li>
                <li>31–50%: green-yellow, "you're feeling it, but fine"</li>
                <li>51–70%: yellow, mild pulsing, active balancing</li>
                <li>71–90%: orange, heavy pulsing, "you are pushing it"</li>
                <li>91–99%: red, "imminent stagger"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>On threshold breach:
              <ul>
                <li>200 ms smooth fill on the hit</li>
                <li>500 ms threshold flash</li>
                <li>Bar scale up to 110%, then settle back to 100%</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The point is the same as with the ECS timing table: when we discuss a change, we're not arguing about whether a mech "feels too squishy." We're asking specific questions like "should a medium frame really survive three full autocannon bursts at 85% stability without hitting hard stagger?"
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>States instead of stuns</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the work happens <em>before</em> you actually stagger.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stability bar is partitioned into <strong>pre-stagger warning states</strong>. They all share the same idea: the more stability you burn, the more of your mech's motion budget is spent on staying upright instead of doing what you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simplified version of the ladder looks like this:
          </p>

          <h4>Stage 1 – Stable Foundation (0–30%)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Posture: standard combat stance.</li>
            <li>Gait: normal stride length and cadence.</li>
            <li>Crosshair: steady.</li>
            <li>Screen: no stability-specific effects.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Stage 2 – Initial Compensation (31–50%)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Small head-bob and camera sway.</li>
            <li>Slight inertial delay on rapid direction changes.</li>
            <li>Stability bar gains a gentle yellow tint.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Stage 3 – Active Balancing (51–70%)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Stride shortens; foot plants become more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Walk cycle slows by ~25%.</li>
            <li>Crosshair sway increases; fine aim requires more correction.</li>
            <li>Stability bar pulses in yellow.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Stage 4 – Critical Instability (71–90%)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Shuffle steps, constant posture corrections.</li>
            <li>Stronger camera sway; screen-space vignette around the edges.</li>
            <li>Stability bar pulses in orange with higher intensity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Stage 5 – Imminent Stagger (91–99%)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Every movement feels hesitant; short "catch" animations on sharp inputs.</li>
            <li>Input smoothing increases slightly—your mech is fighting you.</li>
            <li>Stability bar is red, with a sharp pulse on each impact.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Nothing here removes your agency. You can still move, aim, and fire. The system is simply telling you: you are spending more and more of your mech's control authority on fighting basic physics. If you keep greedily peeking at 95% stability, you are volunteering to lose the next trade.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Crossing the line: stagger and knockdown</h3>
          <p>
            When an impact pushes you past your class threshold, the system runs a fixed <strong>stagger trigger sequence</strong> over a couple of seconds. It is not a black-box "you're stunned now" event; it is a scripted, class-tuned set of poses that gives you and everyone around you a clear read on what just happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simplified timeline:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frames 0–5 (~0–83 ms)</strong><br>
              Impact: white hit flash, stability bar overshoots threshold, small camera jolt.</li>
            <li><strong>Frames 6–15 (~84–250 ms)</strong><br>
              Stumble: mech lurches, movement speed drops by ~50%.</li>
            <li><strong>Frames 16–30 (~251–500 ms)</strong><br>
              Catch: arms and upper body swing out, one knee may dip as the mech tries to brace.</li>
            <li><strong>Frames 31–60 (~0.5–1.0 s)</strong><br>
              Stabilize: wide stance, center of gravity lowered, locomotion heavily constrained.</li>
            <li><strong>Frames 61–120 (~1–2 s)</strong><br>
              Hold: frozen in stagger pose; strong aim penalties, most high-mobility abilities disabled.</li>
            <li><strong>Frames 121–180 (~2–3 s)</strong><br>
              Recover: posture blends back toward normal, movement and aim unlock in steps.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Class tuning makes the same mechanic feel very different:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Light frames</strong> lean farther and look close to face-planting; stagger durations are shorter and they snap back into motion more quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy/assault frames</strong> barely move their upper bodies but end up in exaggerated brace stances; once committed to stagger they spend longer there.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Knockdowns sit on top of this, but the bar to hit one is deliberately high:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You typically need a <strong>large burst of stability damage</strong> in a short window (e.g., a point-blank explosive + a bad landing + pre-existing high stability).</li>
            <li>Environmental events—building collapses, bridge failures, cliff falls—use the same stability logic but apply big, rare spikes.</li>
            <li>When a full knockdown happens, it lasts around five seconds and carries heavy audiovisual treatment; it is meant to be the consequence of a serious chain of mistakes or a rare "super-weapon" effect, not a routine zoning tool.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Under the hood this is just a finite-state machine stepping through:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Safe → Warning → Critical → Staggered → Recovering → (rarely) Knocked Down
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The ECS layer treats this as another bit of per-entity state. The physics stagger system is the policy that says which animations, camera behaviors, and ability gates should be active for each range.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Chains, immunity, and why you can't be juggled forever</h3>
          <p>
            Once you introduce a visible stability bar and a satisfying stagger pose, players will try to chain it. That is a design goal. The other goal is making sure they can't do it forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            PHALANX uses a simple <strong>stagger chain system</strong>:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <figcaption><strong>Table 2: Stagger chains</strong></figcaption>
            <table>
              <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Chain #</th>
                <th>Time Window (since last stagger)</th>
                <th>Visual Effect</th>
                <th>Duration Modifier</th>
              </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>1st</td>
                <td>Base</td>
                <td>Yellow outline</td>
                <td>1.0×</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>2nd</td>
                <td>Within 10 s</td>
                <td>Orange outline</td>
                <td>1.2×</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>3rd</td>
                <td>Within 10 s</td>
                <td>Red outline + "VULNERABLE" tag</td>
                <td>1.5×</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Immune</td>
                <td>After 3rd</td>
                <td>Blue shield effect</td>
                <td>5 s immunity</td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </figure>

          <p>
            This does three things at once:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rewards focused follow-up.</strong><br>
              If you stagger someone and coordinate a second, well-timed burst, you get a longer punish window on the 2nd and 3rd staggers.</li>
            <li><strong>Caps the worst-case lockout.</strong><br>
              After the 3rd stagger in the chain, the target gets a short <strong>stagger immunity window</strong>. Stability can still be damaged, but the system will not enter the full stagger pose again until that immunity expires. There is also a hard cap on total staggered time within a recent window.</li>
            <li><strong>Keeps it legible.</strong><br>
              Each chain stage has a distinct outline color and HUD treatment. If you are about to hit a "red outline, VULNERABLE" target, you know exactly what you're buying. If you see a blue immunity shield, you know further stagger attempts are just wasting uptime.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In practice: you can absolutely bully a mech that keeps peeking at 80%+ stability into a couple of nasty staggers. You cannot set up a 30-second unplayable juggle just because your aim is good.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Environment and physics hooks</h3>
          <p>
            Stability is not just a number that weapons push on. The environment gets a vote.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the early failures in prototyping was treating "getting hit by a railgun" and "landing badly on a wet hillside" as distinct code paths. They are not; they are both impulses that push you away from your center of mass. The stability system is easier to reason about if everything that can topple you speaks the same language: <em>stability damage per event</em>, plus a small set of modifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The engine exposes three main inputs into stability from the world:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Terrain slope and footing</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Impact vector and speed</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Surface conditions (wet, loose, unstable)</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each of these is aggressively bounded. You should feel the difference between a dry city street and a muddy hill without ever thinking "the game rolled a d20 and I lost."
          </p>

          <h4>Terrain and slope</h4>
          <p>
            The simplest modifier is slope. The rule of thumb:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Walking on flat ground: no modifier.</li>
            <li>Gentle incline: tiny background stability drain, more noticeable for overweight mechs.</li>
            <li>Steep slope: you are effectively <strong>pre-spending</strong> some of your stability budget just to remain upright.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In code, slope becomes a scalar:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compute the <strong>slope angle</strong> at your feet.</li>
            <li>Look up a <strong>slope coefficient</strong> in a small curve:
              <ul>
                <li>0–10° → 0×</li>
                <li>10–20° → up to +10% stability damage</li>
                <li>20–30° → up to +25%</li>
                <li>30°+ → heavily discouraged; just moving adds a small stability trickle every second</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The direction of impacts matters too. Running <strong>downhill into incoming fire</strong> is much riskier than backing slowly up the same slope; the impact helper takes the surface normal into account when computing effective stability damage.
          </p>

          <h4>Impact vector and movement speed</h4>
          <p>
            Weapon hits and collisions both go through a helper that maps "how hard did we hit" to a stability impulse:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inputs:
              <ul>
                <li>Relative velocity at impact</li>
                <li>Mass of attacker and target</li>
                <li>Impact direction vs mech's facing</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Output:
              <ul>
                <li>A stability delta in points</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Side impacts and hits from behind get a modest bonus; frontal hits are slightly more forgiving. The goal isn't strict physical accuracy; it's rewarding reasonable positioning:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are <strong>broadside to a heavy cannon</strong> at 80% stability, you're volunteering to stagger.</li>
            <li>If you take the same shot on the nose with fresh stability, you'll feel it, but probably won't tip over.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Movement is treated similarly. Hard landings, mis-timed dashes, and "I tried to stop in time" events add stability damage proportional to entry speed, capped per class. Assault mechs can afford to land harder; light frames need more respect for drop angles.
          </p>

          <h4>Surface conditions</h4>
          <p>
            Weather and surface properties are additive, not dominant. A wet metal catwalk over a refinery should be scary—but not coin-flip random.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surface condition is a small multiplier on top of everything else:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normal ground: 1.0×</li>
            <li>Loose sand, gravel: 1.1×</li>
            <li>Wet / oily metal: 1.15×</li>
            <li>Ice-equivalent surfaces (rare, heavily telegraphed): 1.25×</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These modifiers apply both to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-induced</strong> stability events: sliding, braking, bad landings.</li>
            <li><strong>Incoming</strong> events: getting hit while already on that surface.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            They are also visible. Low-traction surfaces have a clear visual language—reflective sheen, blowing sand, distinct color grading—so you can see the extra risk. If you sprint an already-shaky mech across a rain-slick catwalk under fire, that is not the system ambushing you; that is you cashing in your stability budget at a premium.

          <h3>Abilities, heat, and the stability bar</h3>
          <p>
            On paper, the stability system could have remained a pure physics-and-weapons mechanic. In practice, the interesting behaviors appear once it interacts with <strong>abilities</strong> and <strong>heat</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Abilities in PHALANX live in a table-driven system. Among other fields, each entry carries:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Energy cost</li>
            <li>Heat cost</li>
            <li>Cooldown</li>
            <li>Stability flags:
              <ul>
                <li>Usable while soft-staggered?</li>
                <li>Consumes stability?</li>
                <li>Restores stability?</li>
                <li>Locks stability regen briefly?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That gives us three especially useful patterns.
          </p>

          <h4>1. Posture reset tools</h4>
          <p>
            Some abilities are explicitly designed to let you push back against the stability system. A generic example:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <strong>Recenter</strong><br>
            Cost: moderate energy, moderate cooldown<br>
            Effect:<br>
            – Immediately halts passive stability decay<br>
            – Applies a sharp, short <strong>stability reduction</strong> (e.g., −30 points)<br>
            – Locks stability regen for 1 second (no free double-dip)<br>
            – Flagged as <strong>usable in soft stagger</strong>, but not in hard stagger
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The net effect:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you're disciplined and hit Recenter in Stage 3–4 ("active balancing" / "critical instability"), you can peel yourself back into a safer band and avoid a full stagger.</li>
            <li>If you wait until you're already in a full stagger, it's too late; the system will not let you erase the punish window you just earned.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Design-wise, Recenter is the canonical example of "trade energy and a cooldown for a chunk of stability, on your terms."
          </p>

          <h4>2. High-commit burst abilities</h4>
          <p>
            Other abilities deliberately <strong>spend stability</strong> as part of their effect. Heavy recoil shots, mobility lunges, or overloaded melee swings are written as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply damage / movement effect.</li>
            <li>Apply:
              <ul>
                <li>Immediate stability damage to the <strong>target</strong>.</li>
                <li>Smaller, but non-zero stability damage to <strong>the caster</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Light frames, with their low thresholds, feel this immediately. If you keep chaining high-commit lunges at 80%+ stability to chase a kill, you will drag yourself into stagger as surely as your target. Assault frames can get away with this more often, but their slower recovery punishes them more if they misjudge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because everything is table-driven, designers can do this without inventing new subsystems. The stability column for an ability is just another explicit budget entry, next to heat and energy.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Heat as a stability tax</h4>
          <p>
            Heat is already its own system, with damage, shutdown, and visual effects. Stability borrows just enough of it to create a simple rule:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>At <strong>low to moderate heat</strong>, stability regen is normal.</li>
            <li>In a <strong>high-heat band</strong>, stability regen slows or pauses.</li>
            <li>At <strong>critical heat</strong>, some classes become more vulnerable to stability damage.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The actual numbers can be conservative; we don't need huge multipliers to make this meaningful. What matters is that a mech sitting at 95% heat and 70% stability is in an intentionally dangerous regime:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One more bad trade → stagger or knockdown.</li>
            <li>One more greedy ability → overheat and lose weapons.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This matches the overall budget philosophy: fights in PHALANX are not about one bar you keep full. They're about balancing several related budgets—health, heat, energy, stability—and deciding which one you're willing to burn to win a particular interaction.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Failure modes and guardrails</h3>
          <p>
            If all we did was connect weapons, environment, abilities, and heat to the stability bar, we'd have a nice unified system that is also very capable of producing degenerate behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the guardrails exist to prevent three specific failure modes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Perma-stagger chains</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Invisible death spirals</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Visual saturation</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>1. Perma-stagger chains</h4>
          <p>
            The stagger chain table already hints at the main mitigation: hard caps.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maximum stagger chain within a single engagement: three.</li>
            <li>Forced <strong>immunity window</strong> after the third stagger.</li>
            <li>Hard limit on aggregate stagger time over a short horizon (you cannot spend half the last 30 seconds in hard stagger).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From a player's point of view, this feels like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first stagger is a warning: "You over-extended."</li>
            <li>The second is a punish: "You did it again."</li>
            <li>The third is a hard lesson: "You are out of position and your opponents are coordinating."</li>
            <li>After that, the game steps in and says: "That's enough; if they want more, they have to go through your health bar instead of your control."</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>2. Invisible death spirals</h4>
          <p>
            Stability is the sort of mechanic that, if left opaque, can quietly shove you from "I'm fine" to "I can't play for four seconds" without you understanding why. The combat feedback design leans hard against that outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            The short list of protections:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>UI always shows absolute state.</strong><br>
              You can always see both your current stability and your class threshold. No hidden penalties.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-stagger stages are loud.</strong><br>
              Camera, animation, and audio effects escalate in a predictable way as you move through warning bands. If you're in Stage 4–5 and keep pushing, you're doing it with your eyes open.</li>
            <li><strong>State transitions are chunked and named.</strong><br>
              Soft stagger vs hard stagger vs knockdown are distinct, labeled states, not "a bit more wobble." The system is explicit about which one you're in, how long it will last, and what you can still do.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Combined with deterministic thresholds, you end up with a system that can be harsh but is rarely mysterious.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Visual saturation</h4>
          <p>
            The last failure mode is subtler. If the stability system is always screaming at you—all bars pulsing, every mech in permanent screen shake—you stop seeing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few specific caps prevent that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Only a subset of class-based warning effects can be active at once. If heat and stability are both in critical bands, they coordinate visuals instead of stacking into a mess.</li>
            <li>Spectator and kill-cam views flatten some of the more aggressive motion while keeping the bar and outline cues; you can see <em>what</em> happened without inheriting the full first-person trauma.</li>
            <li>In dense fights, the system prioritizes <strong>your mech</strong> and <strong>your current target</strong> for high-intensity cues; everything else gets a toned-down variant.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From the stability system's perspective, these are presentation details. From the player's perspective, they are the difference between "I can track the fight" and "I'm trying to read my instruments through a fireworks show."
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Putting it together: one greedy peek</h3>
          <p>
            To make this concrete, consider a simple lane scenario.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You are piloting a <strong>medium mech</strong>.</li>
            <li>You've just won a trade at a corner:
              <ul>
                <li>Heat: 75%</li>
                <li>Energy: 40%</li>
                <li>Stability: 60% (Stage 3: active balancing)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The enemy <strong>assault mech</strong> is retreating around the corner at ~40% health.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You have two options.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Option A: Respect your stability bar.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You hold cover, hit Recenter, let stability regen tick you back into Stage 2, and wait for your team to reset. The assault disappears, but you are alive and stable for the next fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Option B: Greedy peek.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You charge the corner with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>High heat (slower stability regen)</li>
            <li>Stage 3 stability (already in active balancing)</li>
            <li>Medium-class thresholds (easier to stagger than a heavy)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The assault is waiting with a short-fuse explosive and a shoulder-check ability that adds stability damage. You eat:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One explosive hit (large stability spike)</li>
            <li>One shove (directional impact from the side)</li>
            <li>A slope modifier from the downhill angle you just sprinted onto</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The net effect:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your stability crosses the medium threshold in one burst.</li>
            <li>You enter soft stagger, then hard stagger as the follow-up lands.</li>
            <li>Your camera and pose broadcast that you're in a punishable state.</li>
            <li>The enemy team cleans up the kill with minimal risk.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From a distance this looks like a normal over-extension. Under the hood, it was a stability failure: you spent too much of a finite balance on weapon recoil, heat, terrain, and bad timing, and then had nothing left when the last push came due.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is the actual design goal for the system. Not "we invented a clever bar," but:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            When a mech falls over in PHALANX, it's because the pilot made a series of understandable, visible trades against a stability budget—and then ran out.
